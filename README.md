# Nuke scanner
  
This scanner can search for nuke codes (Go cry to your mom if you don't know what they are) in a telegram chat and store them for later  
You can download the file as text for now. Maybe I'll add a feature to export as csv later.  
  
## Limitations:
- Only works on telegram web
- The codes gets reset every time you close the browser
- Export type is only txt. No csv support
- manifest version 2 will be removed in 2023
  
  
## Fixes:
- Clicking on a link now leads to the corresponding nhentai link (Clicking on 188013 will lead you to [https://nhentai.net/g/177013/](https://nhentai.net/g/177013/)  
- Links doesn't disappear when closing the tab
- Stops crashing on export
  
  
## Installation:
  
Download this repo  
Extract the codes somewhere in your pc  
Go to extension settings in your browser (eg [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) [edge://extensions](edge://extensions)  
Enable **Developer Mode**  
Click on "**Load Unpacked**"  
Select the directory where you unpacked the files  
Click okay
